# MNIST
Comparison of techniques for predicting MNIST images.  This is based on the datasets available in the Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) on this data.  I compare the results of a random forest, a PCA with random forest, and a PCA with random forest using scaled data.
